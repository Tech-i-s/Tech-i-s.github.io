# Data Science Portfolio

Here, I have explored various ML algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

##Seoul Bike Project
* What are the factors that influence the number of bikes rented?
* Explore the data for outliers and missing values.
* Plot the correlation between the variables and state your comments
* Built a linear regression model to predict rented bike count by choosing appropriate independent variables.
* Commented on model performance by using approapriate diagnostics and measures

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier]()

<img src="images/breast-cancer.jpeg?raw=true"/>

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
