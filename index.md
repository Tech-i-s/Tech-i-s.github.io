# Data Science Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

[Examining the effect of environmental factors and weather on Bike rentals](/sample_page)

<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model
- Encoded categorical variables to numeric using Sklearn due to the presence of many string columns
- Fit a multiple linear regression model with high prediction accuracy through iteration

[Diagnosis of breast cancer using a logistic classifier](/sample_page)

<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Measure various attributes of tumorous growths and classifying them as benign or malignant
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](/sample_page)

<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters.
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data.
