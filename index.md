# Data Science Portfolio

Here, I have explored various ML algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

## [Seoul Bike Rental Prediction](https://github.com/lmkwytnicholas/nicholas-lee.github.io/blob/master/Seoul_Bikes_Project.ipynb)
* Data from UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand)
* *What are the factors that influence the number of bikes rented?*
  * Explored the data for outliers and missing values
  * Plotted correlation between the variables
  * Built a linear regression model to predict rented bike count by choosing appropriate independent variables
* **Conclusion**: My analysis shows that the time of day (`Hour`) and the climate for the day (`Temperature(C)`) were the strongest determinants for the likelihood of renting a bike. It can also be said that more data is needed to conclude a stronger relationship between these variables and the target value for predicting the likelihood for renting a bicycle.

- Used logistic regression to identify a tumour as malignant or benign based on various attributes
- Classified tumors as benign or malignant by studying patterns in measured attributes of those tumors
- Used Logistic regression classifier & optimized the accuracy by using the ROC curve
- Explored a machine learning approach to medical diagnosis

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal]()

<img src="images/knee-brace-ortho.png?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data
- Selected best model based on train and test performance
