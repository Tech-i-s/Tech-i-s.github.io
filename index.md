# [Seoul Bike Rental Prediction](https://github.com/lmkwytnicholas/nicholas-lee.github.io/blob/d0d0b9f4aa8f8963ceffdb97a85e67f65b6e6449/Seoul_Bike_Rental_Prediction.ipynb)
* **Data**: UCI ML Repository: [Seoul Bike Sharing Demand Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Seoul+Bike+Sharing+Demand)
* **Objective**: Determine features that best determine likelihood for renting a bike.
* **Models**: Linear Regression, Lasso & Ridge Regression Modeling
* **Conclusion**: Features of the dataset, `Temperature(C)`, `Hour` and `Dew Point Temperature(C)` showed the strongest relationships for predicting whether customers will rent a bicycle on a given day according to the dataset tested for Linear, Lasso, and Ridge Regression Modeling.

# [New Bank Customer Classification](https://github.com/lmkwytnicholas/nicholas-lee.github.io/blob/master/New_Bank_Customer_Classification.ipynb)
* Data from UCI Machine Learning Repository: [Bank Marketing Data Set](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Bank+Marketing)
* **Objective**: Classify whether a customer will become a new customer e.g. - subscribe a term deposit
* Logistic Regression Modeling
* **Conclusion**: Model fit to dataset proved to be effective for accurately classifying whether a customer will make a term deposit or not
	* Precision Score: 93%
	* Recall Score: 97%
