# Data Science Projects Portfolio

Here are some of my best Data Science Projects. I have explored various machine-learning algorithms for different datasets. Feel free to contanct me to learn more about my experience working with these projects.

- Used Linear Regression to predict the number of bikes rented in the city of Seoul
- The data had quite a few categorical variables which were encoded for use in the model

[Identifying symptoms of orthopedic patients as normal or abnormal](/sample_page)

<img src="images/dummy_thumbnail.jpg?raw=true"/>

- Used the K Nearest Neighbours algorithm to classify a patient's condition as normal or abnormal based on various orthopedic parameters.
- Compared predictive performance by fitting a Naive Bayes model to the data.
